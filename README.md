# DS-RDMPD

**A Dual-Stage Residual Diffusion Model with Perceptual Decoding for Remote Sensing Image Dehazing**

This repository contains the resources for our proposed **DS-RDMPD** framework, a dual-stage residual diffusion model designed for effective remote sensing image dehazing. It incorporates a perceptual decoding module to enhance visual quality and structural restoration, especially under challenging atmospheric conditions.

> ⚠️ The code is still under refinement and will be released soon.
